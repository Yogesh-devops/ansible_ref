Modules:
Core Modules Extra Modules and Custom Modules
Core Modules are included with Ansible and are written and manitained by the Ansible developent team. Core Modules are the most important modules and are used for common administration tasks.
Extra Modules are currently with Ansible but may be promoted to core or shipped separately in the future. They are generally not maintained by the Ansible team but by the community. Typically these modules implement features for managin newer techonologies such as OpenStack.
Custom Modules are modules devloped by the end users and not shipped by Ansible. If a modules does not already exist for a task, an administrator can write a new module to implement it.
